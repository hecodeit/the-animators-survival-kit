# The Animator's Survival Kit
A study log of The Animator's Survival Kit, a book by Richard Williams.

## Motivation
The first animations I have made it's with Flash many many years ago. I'm draw on timeline, write script control the spirit that interaction with mouse or keyboard. It's the very first step I'm beginning work with graphic design, animation and programming. Later I become graphic designer and programmer, working on graphic design, creative coding, web/app design and development area.

Few month ago, I working with LottieFile animation for one client. Later, I am very interested in make illustration and animation for website and Mobile Apps.

By google resources of on internet, I read the book and watch the video course of "The Animator's Survival Kit" by Richard Williams. It is change everything I think about animation. Before the book, I think animation is some kinds of production by SoftWear. Now I find it is really no concern with software. But a way to planning, design and produce moving pictures, it's an art that emotionally move your audience.

There, I will write everything I learned.

## The Animation Principles
There many Animation Principles on internet, by books, blog, youtube... The most famous one is "Twelve basic principles of animation" by the Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their book. For understanding all kinds of these principles, I ask myself what's the most important principles? What these principles working for?

## It's All In The Timing And Spacing
Even the not trained eyes, can be easy to find the huge different between vivid animation with lifeless puppet animationã€‚So what's the realy difference between them?
<div id="animation_a"></div>
<script>
  var animation = bodymovin.loadAnimation({
    container: document.getElementById('animation_a'),
    renderer: 'svg',
    loop: true,
    autoplay: true,
    path: 'lottie/03_timing_and_spacing_a.json'
  });
  //animation.goToAndStop(8, true);
</script>
