# The Animator's Survival Kit
A study log of The Animator's Survival Kit, a book by Richard Williams.

## Motivation
The first animations I have made which use SoftWear Adobe Flash, many many years ago. I'm draw on stage, play with timeline, write script control the spirit which interact with mouse and keyboard. It's the very first step I'm beginning work with graphic design, animation and programming. Later I become graphic designer and programmer, working on graphic design, creative coding, web/app design and development area.

Few month ago, I working with LottieFile animation for one client. Later, I am very interested in how make perfect illustration and animation for Website or Mobile Apps.

By googling resources of on internet, I read the book and watch the video course of "The Animator's Survival Kit" by Richard Williams. It is change everything I think about animation. Before the book, I think animation is some kinds of production by SoftWear. Now I find it is really no concern with software. But a way to planning, design and produce moving pictures, it's an art that emotionally move your audience.

There, I will write everything I learned.

## The Animation Principles
<div id="animation" style="max-width:600px;"></div>
<script>
  var animation = bodymovin.loadAnimation({
    container: document.getElementById('animation'),
    renderer: 'svg',
    loop: true,
    autoplay: true,
    path: 'lottie/03_ball.json'
  });
</script>
If you googling how make animation, you will find people talk about Animation Principles. On internet, books, youtube... The most famous one is [Twelve basic principles of animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation) by the Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their book.

Why Animation Principles? How understanding all these kinds of principles? I'm asking myself. What these principles working for? What's the most important principles?

As well knows that even not trained person, can easily find the huge different between vivid animation with lifeless puppet animation. So what happen when people watch an animation? I will pass away from all kinds of principles first, to find why things work out.

> **_There are lots of principles, formula, cliches and devices here to help, but the main thing I want to pass on is way of thinking about animation in order to free the mind to do the best work possible._**
