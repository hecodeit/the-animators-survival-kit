# The Animator's Survival Kit
A study log of The Animator's Survival Kit, a book by Richard Williams.

## Motivation
The first animations I have made with Flash many may years ago. I'm draw on timeline, write script control the spirit that interaction with mouse or keyboard. It's the very first step I'm beginning work with graphic design, animation and programming. Later I become graphic designer and programmer, working on graphic design, creative coding, web/app design and development field.

Few month ago, I working with LottieFile animation for one client. Later, I am interested in make illustration and animation for website and Mobile Apps.

By google resources on internet, I read the book and watch the course of "The Animator's Survival Kit" by Richard Williams. It is change everything I think about animation. Before the book, I think animation is some kinds of production by SoftWear. Now I find it is really no concern with software but a way to planning, design and making moving pictures that emotionally move your audience.

There, I will write everything I learned.

## The Animation Principles
There many Animation Principles on internet, by blog, youtube... The most famous one is "Twelve basic principles of animation" by the Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their book. For understanding all kinds of these principles, I ask myself what's the most important principles? What these principles working for?

Even by no training eyes, it's very easy to find the huge different between vivid animation with lifeless puppet animationã€‚It's all about how make moving picture catch the attention, can be understand, make emotion.

## It's All In The Timing And Spacing
